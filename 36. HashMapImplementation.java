/*

implementation of HashMap:

  - O(1)
  - put()
  - get()
  - containsKey()
  - remove()
  - size()
  - keySet()

NOTE: HashMap is internally implemented as Array of LinkedList. (you must remember this)
we can call each array index as "bucket" :)

in simple language we can define hashing as -> data form change.
example: "abc" --> 3424 (this change is done by hashing).

hashing is used while making passwords. suppose, you are creating an instagram account and you set your password
as "abcd" but in instagram's database it'll be stored as "137hfh%^h". this is how hashing works.

remember that detergent brand named 'Ghari'?
if you do, then surely you remember their famous tagline - "Pehle istemaal karein, fir vishwas karein"
if we simplify the term 'Backtracking', the meaning is same.

cool, right? B)

simple definition --> find all possible solutions & use the one you want.

example: arrange 3 kids in a single line. [permutation concept]
  1. kid A
  2. kid B
  3. kid C

total permutations = n! = 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6

=> {ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA}

same these types of quesions when we try to solve with Recursion, we use the concept of Backtracking.

a recursion tree is a visual representation of a recursive algorithm, illustrating how the function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case.
in java, recursion is a powerful technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
